# Popular Github repositories

This is an example project for popular Github repositories. It
showcases the following:

-   How I would use plain vanilla javascript to make a simple dynamic page
-   KISS pagination in a fetched list from API
-   Separate logic into four blocks:
-   -   "State", i.e. variables that are updated, and should be reflected in GUI
-   -   REF/Const: variables that should not be updated
-   -   Render: Functions dealing with dynamic HTML
-   -   Dynamic web: API calls, event handlers, also making sure the app eventually render
